An additional layer of abstraction for creating repositories following the BLoC pattern architecture

## Motivation
The existing BLoC libraries are amazing for handling state managment in Flutter projects. However, the boundaries for creating `Repositores` is are way too loose. In `package:flutter_bloc`, a `Repository` can literally be any class. This package solves that problem by creating a class, `Repository`, which all the repositories can inherit from.

Another problem is repository-to-repository communication. A repository should be fairly independent of other repositories and their implementations. However, sometimes a repository needs to call a method in another repository. To decouple repositories from each other, this package contains a method channel which can be used to communicate between repositories.

## Getting started
1. Create a `RepositoryChannel`
   ```dart
    class MyRepositoryChannel extends RepositoryChannel{
        // Add your custom repository events here

        MyRepositoryChannel({
             required super.log, 
             required this.myCustomCallback,
        });

        final void Function() myCustomCallback;
    }
   ```

2. Create `Repository` and use the channel
    ```dart
    class MyRepository extends Repository<MyRepositoryChannel>{
        MyRepository({
            required MyRepositoryChannel channel,
        }) super(channel);

    /// You can override the `initialize` and `dispose` methods, like so
    @override
    FutureOr<void> initialize(){
        // Do own initialization
        super.initialize();
    }

     Future<void> doSomething() async {
        channel.log('Starting to do something!');

        // Do something

        channel.myCustomCallback();

        channel.log('Finished doing something!');
     }
    }
    ```
3. Use the repository
    ```dart
    Widget build(BuildContext context){
        return RepositoryProvider<MyRepository>(
            create: (_) => MyRepository(
                channel: MyRepositoryChannel(
                    log: (value) => print(value),
                    myCustomCallback: () {},
                );
            );
        );
    }
    ```
